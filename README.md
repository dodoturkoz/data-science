# Python-projects
## SIR Model
Simulated the spread of a disease using the SIR model by solving a system of differential equations using the Numpy and SciPy libraries and the Matplotlib library to plot the results. 

## Bike Demand Prediction
Predicted rental bike demand data in a metropolitan city by comparing three different machine-learning models from the Scikit-learn library. Analysed the data using Pandas and Seaborn libraries.

## Geometric Brownian Motion
Explored a stochastic differential equation to investigate geometric brownian motion which is often used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in the Blackâ€“Scholes model.

## The Sharpe Ratio (Risk and Returns)
Completed the DataCamp project on the Sharpe ratio, which is used to compare the return of an investment with its risk.
